# LungCancer_Problem

### Problem Statement:

I worked on one of the most important topics which is the detection and classification of cancer in lungs. there are multiple steps to perform to get
the result which is to detect and classify lung tumors. there are two types of lung tumors(malignant and benign), the benign is the tumor which means 
the patient doesn't have any cancer, and malignant means it has cancer.
