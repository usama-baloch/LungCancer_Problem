# LungCancer_Problem

### Problem Statement:

I worked on one of the most important topics which is the detection and classification of cancer in lungs. there are multiple steps to perform to get
the result which is to detect and classify lung tumors. there are two types of lung tumors(malignant and benign), the benign is the tumor which means 
the patient doesn't have any cancer, and malignant means it has cancer.

### Dataset:

-> We have a dataset that contains CT Scans which are essentially 3D X-rays, represented as a 3D Array of single-channel data, this is like a
stacked set of grayscale PNG images.

-> Just as a pixel exists within a two-dimensional space (like the rows and columns of a digital image),
a voxel exists within a three-dimensional space. This space is defined by three axes: length, width, and height.

-> CT scans utilize X-ray technology, but instead of a single projection, they involve taking multiple X-ray images from different angles around the body.

-> These multiple X-ray images are then reconstructed using computer algorithms to create cross-sectional slices or three-dimensional representations of the internal structures

#### What is Nodule?

Here: a Nodule is a solid mass of tissue that forms when abnormal cells group in the lung in a tumor. A tumor can be benign or malignant.
If it is benign then there is no cancer but if it is malignant then it is.  A small tumor in the lung (just a few millimeters wide) is called a nodule.
40% of lung nodules turn out to be malignant.
